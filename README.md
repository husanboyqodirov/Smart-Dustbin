# Smart Dustbin (Raspberry Pi)

* The purpose of our project is to provide a supervision device for intelligent waste bin. This device integrates several sensors to manage the state of the trash. 
* Smart Dustbin is simply speaking a trash bin that automatically opens when you come close to throw trash.  
* It has a blind mode feature which makes a sound that helps blind people to locate the bin before throwing trash.  
* It can even be used as a secret surveillance tool using camera or room condition checker for temperature and light.   
* Itâ€™s so cool that you will not want to throw trash in it. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜Ž

## Features & Testing
* Servo Motor automatically opens dustbin cover when Ultrasonic Sensor detects an object within 50cm.
* RGB alerts by turning Red, Green, Blue colors consecutively for a short moment.
* If blind mode is enabled, Active Buzzer makes a sound for blind person to locate the dustbin.
* Closes cover automatically after 3 seconds.
