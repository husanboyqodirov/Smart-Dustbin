# smart-dustbin
Smart Dustbin developed in Raspberry Pi.  

The purpose of our project is to provide a supervision device for intelligent waste bin. This device integrates several sensors to supervise the state of the trash. 
Smart Dustbin is simply speaking a trash bin that automatically opens when you come close to throw trash.  
It has a blind mode feature that helps blind people to locate the bin before throwing trash.  
It can even be used as a secret surveillance tool or room condition checker.  
Combination of many sensors.  
Itâ€™s so cool that you will not want to throw trash in it. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜Ž
